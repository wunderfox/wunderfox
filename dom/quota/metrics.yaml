dom.quota.try:
  error_step:
    type: event
    description: >
      An event recorded on an error of the quota manager or its clients.
      Since errors are usually propagated up the call chain, all such
      propagation steps are recorded for an error. This is only active
      during specific contexts, in particular during storage
      initialization. No dynamic data is included in the event beyond the
      error code which will be added through Bug 1670555.
      This event was generated to correspond to the Legacy Telemetry event
      dom.quota.try.error#step.
