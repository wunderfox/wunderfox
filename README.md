Project goals
=============
- A fork of Firefox 131.
- Linux is the main supported platform, while Windows will also be supported.
- Reduced source code size and complexity: Clean up source code, simplify, reduce complexity, speed up compile times.
- Do not spy on users: Remove telemetry. 
- "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away"
- Identify bloat to remove: Remove complex technologies which are not of benefit for users. Ideas: WebGPU, Rust-based Components, WebRTC, WebExtensions, Telemetry and Data Collection, Pocket Integration, DevTools, DOM Bindings for Unused APIs, Social API, Accessibility Tools.
- Support for computers of many different types, for example small embedded PCs such as Raspberry PI.
- Consider removing support for plugins, if it will make a faster more reliable browser.
- Reconsider if Rust in Firefox is a good idea.
- Wunderfox is maintained is a small altruistic open source project, it is not controlled by a search engine corporation like Google or Netscape.

A web of many browsers
======================
- Firefox is a fine web browser, we encourage more people to use Firefox again. https://roytanck.com/2023/12/23/in-2024-please-switch-to-firefox/
- The Pale Moon browser is a friend project which has similar goals. Wunderfox can try different approaches, to be a different Firefox fork.
- Wunderfox is in the same philosophical line as the Opera browser, Vivaldi and Pale Moon.
